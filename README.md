# Style_Transfer_With_Deep-learning
---

This project demonstrates neural style transfer using deep learning in Python with TensorFlow and Keras. It allows the blending of two images—one content image and one style image—by optimizing a new image that preserves the content of the former and the artistic style of the latter. The implementation uses a pre-trained VGG19 network to extract content and style features, and applies iterative optimization to generate the stylized output. This project provides a practical introduction to the concept of style transfer and its applications in creative AI.
